# fossjobs

[fossjobs](https://www.fossjobs.net/) is the first website exclusively for Free & Open Source jobs. It uses the open source software [Jobberbase](http://www.jobberbase.com/) (see [their README.md](https://github.com/filipcte/jobberbase/blob/master/README.md) for links and installation guides).

You can post a job [on the website](https://www.fossjobs.net), as long as it directly improves FOSS or open hardware projects. You can also submit jobs directly by emailing submit@fossjobs.net.
